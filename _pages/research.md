## Observational Astronomy with Quasars

### High-redshift Quasar Survey with Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS)

 During my Ph.D., I participated in the Infrared Medium-deep Survey(IMS; PI: Prof. Myungshin Im), a near-infrared imaging survey, for which imaging data were obtained with the Wide Field Camera(WFCam) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). Combining this with the optical data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), we have performed a high-redshift quasar survey to find faint quasars. It had been unclear whether such faint quasars could make a considerable contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. Dozens of quasars at z>5 have been discovered so far, and we derived the quasar luminosity function at z\~5 and z\~6. We suggest that quasars are not the main contributors to provide UV photons required to fully ionize hydrogen in the early universe.
