## High-redshift Quasar Survey with IMS

### Discovery of Faint Quasars in the Early Universe

It had been unclear whether faint quasars could make a considerable contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe, due to the lack of such faint quasars.
As a core member of the **Infrared Medium-deep Survey** (IMS; PI: Prof. Myungshin Im @SNU), I have performed a survey for finding high-redshift quasars as faint as M<sub>1450</sub> = -23 mag over the 86 deg<sup>2</sup> area. So far, 24 quasars have been newly discovered at 4.6 < z < 6.3 (Kim, Y., Im, M., et al. 2015,2019,2020,2022), as shown below.

During my Ph.D., I participated in the Infrared Medium-deep Survey(IMS; PI: Prof. Myungshin Im), a near-infrared imaging survey, for which imaging data were obtained with the Wide Field Camera(WFCam) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). Combining this with the optical data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), we have performed a high-redshift quasar survey to find faint quasars. It had been unclear whether such faint quasars could make a considerable contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. Dozens of quasars at z>5 have been discovered so far, and we derived the quasar luminosity function at z\~5 and z\~6. We suggest that quasars are not the main contributors to provide UV photons required to fully ionize hydrogen in the early universe.

### Quasar Luminosity Functions and Minor Contribution to Ionizing Background

Using the IMS quasars, we derived the quasar luminosity function at z\~5 and z\~6, as shown below. Their number densities are lower than the previous expectation from extrapolation of bright ones. Consequently, we concluded that quasars alone could not provide the UV photons required to keep the ionized state of intergalactic medium after the epoch of reionization.
