Hello, I am **Yongjung Kim**, a **Senior Researcher** at [**Korean Astronomy & Space Science Institute (KASI)**](https://kasi.re.kr/) in Daejeon, Republic of Korea.
I am currently working in the group of Dr. Woong-Seob Jeong at KASI, which is conducting [**SPHEREx**](https://spherex.caltech.edu/)-related research.

Before coming to KASI, I was a Sejong Science Fellow at [Kyungpook National University (KNU)](https://hanl.knu.ac.kr/) in Daegu, Republic of Korea, and a KIAA Fellow at [Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA)](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China.
I did my Ph.D. in Astronomy at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea.

I am interested in observational astronomy with quasars along the cosmic time. Specifically, I have been working on their demography and the resultant contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. I am also interested in the formation and growth of the supermassive black holes centered at quasars with their host galaxies along the cosmic time. Please see the [Research page](https://yongjungkim.github.io/research) for detail.
