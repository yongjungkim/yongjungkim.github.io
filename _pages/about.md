Hello, I am a **KIAA Fellow** at [**Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA)**](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China. I am currently working wit [Prof. Linhua Jiang](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~jiang/) at Peking University in Beijing, China. Before coming to KIAA, I did my Ph.D. in Astronomy at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea, advised by [Prof. Myungshin Im](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~mim/).

I am interested in observational astronomy with quasars along the cosmic time. Specifically, I have been working on their demography and the resultant contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. I am also interested in the formation and growth of the supermassive black holes centered at quasars with their host galaxies along the cosmic time. Please see the [Research page](https://yongjungkim.github.io/research) for detail.
