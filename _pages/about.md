Hello, I am **Yongjung Kim**, a **Sejong Science Fellow** at [**Kyungpook National University (KNU)**](https://hanl.knu.ac.kr/) in Daegu, Republic of Korea. I am currently working with Prof. Minjin Kim at KNU. Before coming to KNU, I was a KIAA Fellow at [**Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA)**](http://kiaa.pku.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China, and I have been working with [Prof. Linhua Jiang](http://kavli.pku.edu.cn/~jiang/) at Peking University in Beijing, China. I did my Ph.D. in Astronomy at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea, advised by [Prof. Myungshin Im](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~mim/).

I am interested in observational astronomy with quasars along the cosmic time. Specifically, I have been working on their demography and the resultant contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. I am also interested in the formation and growth of the supermassive black holes centered at quasars with their host galaxies along the cosmic time. Please see the [Research page](https://yongjungkim.github.io/research) for detail.
