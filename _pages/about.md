Hello, I am **Yongjung Kim**, a **Senior Researcher** at [**Korean Astronomy & Space Science Institute (KASI)**](https://kasi.re.kr/) in Daejeon, Republic of Korea.
I am currently working in the Space Astronomy Group of Dr. Woong-Seob Jeong at KASI, which is conducting [**SPHEREx**](https://spherex.caltech.edu/)-related research.

Before coming to KASI, I worked at Kyungpook National University (Daegu, Korea) and Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Beijing, China).
I did my Ph.D. in Astronomy at Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea).
Please find more information on [this page](https://yongjungkim.github.io/cv/).

I am interested in observational astronomy with quasars along the cosmic time. Specifically, I have been working on their demography and the resultant contribution to the cosmic reionization and ionizing background in the early universe. I am also interested in the formation and growth of the supermassive black holes centered at quasars with their host galaxies along the cosmic time. Please see the [Research page](https://yongjungkim.github.io/research) for detail.
